## Riding a bicycle on the street 

It is legal to ride a bicycle on the city streets of Lincoln, but arterial
streets may have designated hours when it is unlawful to operate a bicycle (appropriate regulatory
signs should be erected in such cases). The bicycle must have fully-functioning brakes and operators
must follow the rules of any other road vehicle (Title 10 of the Lincoln Municipal Code). Safety
lights, white front and red rear, must be used if riding in dimmed conditions.
